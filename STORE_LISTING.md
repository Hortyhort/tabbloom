# Icon Guidelines

## Design Concept
A browser tab shape with a blooming flower emerging from it, set against a warm sunset gradient.

## Color Palette
- **Flower center**: Sunset gradient (pink → orange → yellow)
- **Petals**: #FFB7C5 (soft pink) fading to #FFCBA4 (peach)
- **Stem/leaves**: #5D7A4A (warm green)
- **Tab shape**: White or light cream with subtle shadow
- **Background**: Warm sunset gradient (#FFE4D6 → #F8C9A8 → #FFD89B)

## Icon Sizes Needed
- 16x16 px (toolbar) - simplified, recognizable silhouette
- 48x48 px (extensions page) - clear detail
- 128x128 px (store listing) - full detail with gradient

## Icon Elements
1. **Tab shape** as the base/container (rounded rectangle, browser tab silhouette)
2. **Blooming lily** growing up from the tab (3-4 petals)
3. **Green stem** connecting flower to tab
4. **Sunset gradient glow** radiating from flower center
5. Subtle sparkle or warmth effect
6. Rounded corners for friendly, cozy feel

## Icon Style Notes
- Should feel warm, inviting, and slightly magical
- Pixel-perfect at 16x16 while still recognizable
- The tab shape grounds it as a "browser extension"
- The flower represents growth and nurturing
