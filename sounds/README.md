## Sound Design Tips

For ASMR-quality sounds:
- Use soft attack, long decay
- Add reverb for warmth
- Keep frequencies warm (not harsh highs)
- Normalize to -12dB to -6dB (not too loud)
- Export at 44.1kHz, 128kbps MP3

## Fallback

If audio files are missing, TabBloom uses high-quality procedural synthesis as a fallback.
